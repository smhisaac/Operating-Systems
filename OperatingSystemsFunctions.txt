One operating systems function, is that its able to establish a connection to the internet. It's one of many things the hardware of the operating system organizes. The computer can also act as a network participant by defining a specific IP address to connect to. A person can also connect through sub-net and LAN connections. 
Another Operating systems function is the administration of hardware in the system. Even though it's one of the most important functions of the system, it does it all out of sight in the background. Both the input and output hardware use a driver provided by the producer of the hardware. The driver ensures that commands from devices and the hardware itself are received and passed on to the appropriate location, which includes the keyboard, mouse, screen, hard disk, graphics card, and all the other components that make a computer function
Software administration is strongly tied to to the specifications of the operating systems. Even basic computers have interfaces which regulate the communication within individual applications. It enables applications to have system storage assigned, have processing resources, and being responsive towards commands made by mouse and keyboard devices.
